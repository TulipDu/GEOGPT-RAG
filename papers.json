This position paper argues that while AI can support learning, its unchecked use may lead to cognitive atrophy, loss of agency, emotional risks, and ethical concerns, ultimately undermining the core goals of education. Drawing on cognitive science and pedagogy, the paper explores how over-reliance on AI can disrupt meaningful learning, foster dependency and conformity, undermine the students'self-efficacy, academic integrity, and well-being, and raise concerns about questionable privacy practices. It also highlights the importance of considering the students'perspectives and proposes actionable strategies to ensure that AI serves as a meaningful support rather than a cognitive shortcut. The paper advocates for an intentional, transparent, and critically informed use of AI that empowers rather than diminishes the learner."}, {"paperId": "fdacc2c1b11fe9f52caf348b3ca8d99b4d4c4375", "title": "The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in E-Learning : Opportunities and Challenges", "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2357002147", "name": "Antarjyami Mahala"}], "abstract": null}, {"paperId": "6a8cbc607199d6400d60eee21c58cd4536d7fbac", "title": "Artificial Intellihence Tools Used In EducationL A Necessity in Today's Modern World", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2372153843", "name": "Peter Abernathy"}], "abstract": null}]
