This position paper argues that while AI can support learning, its unchecked use may lead to cognitive atrophy, loss of agency, emotional risks, and ethical concerns, ultimately undermining the core goals of education. Drawing on cognitive science and pedagogy, the paper explores how over-reliance on AI can disrupt meaningful learning, foster dependency and conformity, undermine the students'self-efficacy, academic integrity, and well-being, and raise concerns about questionable privacy practices. It also highlights the importance of considering the students'perspectives and proposes actionable strategies to ensure that AI serves as a meaningful support rather than a cognitive shortcut. The paper advocates for an intentional, transparent, and critically informed use of AI that empowers rather than diminishes the learner."}, {"paperId": "0d417f5993976fb1bd08be16562f07da721e2803", "title": "Adapting University Policies for Generative AI: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Solutions in Higher Education", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22231, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Universities in developed regions are increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand, their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly 47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions. Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms, and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and equity."}, {"paperId": "b063e21536b9a5b79e281a6ee2ef33da8638a774", "title": "Computer Science Education in the Age of Generative AI", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: Paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02183, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These tools can generate, debug, and explain code, thereby transforming the landscape of programming instruction. This paper examines the profound opportunities that AI offers for enhancing computer science education in general, from coding assistance to fostering innovative pedagogical practices and streamlining assessments. At the same time, it highlights challenges including academic integrity concerns, the risk of over-reliance on AI, and difficulties in verifying originality. We discuss what computer science educators should teach in the AI era, how to best integrate these technologies into curricula, and the best practices for assessing student learning in an environment where AI can generate code, prototypes and user feedback. Finally, we propose a set of policy recommendations designed to harness the potential of generative AI while preserving the integrity and rigour of computer science education. Empirical data and emerging studies are used throughout to support our arguments."}, {"paperId": "8764d49966d8a53d6ff532988de8c24cbb8d236b", "title": "Using Artificial Intelligence in High School Education: A Review", "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2372071792", "name": "Russel Jean"}, {"authorId": "2372069424", "name": "Paris Perse"}], "abstract": null}]
